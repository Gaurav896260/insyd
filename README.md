# 🏗️ BuildStock: Construction Inventory Intelligence

BuildStock is a specialized inventory management system designed for construction material suppliers (Cement, Steel, Paint, etc.). Unlike generic ERPs, BuildStock focuses on **net margin protection** by identifying dead stock, preventing stockouts, and reconciling physical theft or damage.

---

## 📊 The Core Problem

Most construction businesses suffer from three "invisible" margin killers:

- **Capital Stagnation**: Money frozen in "Dead Stock" (materials with no sales for 180+ days)
- **Inconsistent Data**: Stock updates and sale records often fall out of sync during high-volume periods
- **Stock Shrinkage**: High rates of theft and site damage leading to "ghost inventory" where digital records don't match reality

## 🛠️ The Solution (Engineered Features)

### Atomic Sales Engine
Uses Mongoose Transactions (ACID) to ensure stock deduction and sale logging happen as a single unit of work.

### Scalable Inventory
Implements Server-Side Pagination & Filtering, allowing the system to handle 50,000+ SKUs with zero performance lag.

### Vitality Analytics
Automatically categorizes materials into "Active," "Slow-Moving," and "Dead Stock" based on movement velocity.

### Audit & Reconciliation
A dedicated module to log physical counts, calculate shrinkage, and update system stock with a full audit trail.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB Atlas or local instance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repositories** (Frontend & Backend)

2. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5001
   ```
   
   Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Seed Data** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```
   Populates inventory and sales history for testing analytics.

## 📡 API Endpoints (Architecture)

### Inventory
- `GET /api/inventory` - Fetches paginated items with search/category filters
- `POST /api/inventory` - Adds new materials with unique SKU validation

### Sales (Transaction Protected)
- `POST /api/sales` - Records a sale and atomically updates stock

### Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/dead-stock` - Returns aging reports for capital management
- `GET /api/analytics/fast-moving` - Identifies top-selling SKUs by volume

### Audit
- `POST /api/audit` - Reconciles physical count vs. system count and logs the difference

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15+, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, Recharts |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose |
| **Database** | MongoDB (NoSQL for flexible construction material schemas) |

## 📋 Key Assumptions

To maintain the scope of this implementation, the following assumptions were made:

- **Dead Stock Threshold**: Defined as items with no sale activity for 180 days; "Slow-Moving" is defined as 60 days
- **Lead Time**: Assumes a standard 7-day lead time for reorder calculations unless otherwise specified
- **Fixed Categories**: The system uses predefined categories (Cement, Steel, Tiles, etc.) to ensure data consistency in analytics
- **Atomic Updates**: Assumes all sales must be recorded against a valid SKU with sufficient stock
